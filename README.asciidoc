Zombies Versus Unicorns
-----------------------

__Zombies versus Unicorns is a real life epic battle between man & machine and
the mystic forces surrounding them.__

Zombies versus Unicorns uses a Binary Search Fault Localisation (BSFL)
algorithm to quickly (O(log n)) identify which line in your
++$MYVIMRC++ is causing an unwanted (or even a desired) behaviour.
