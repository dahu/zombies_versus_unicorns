 1. INTRODUCTION                                    *zombies_vs_unicorns-intro*

Zombies versus Unicorns is a real life epic battle between man & machine and
the mystic forces surrounding them.

Zombies versus Unicorns uses a Binary Search Fault Localisation (BSFL)
algorithm to quickly (O(log n)) identify which line in your $MYVIMRC is causing
an unwanted (or even a desired) behaviour.

To start the hunt, type:
<
  :ZombiesVsUnicorns
>

You will be presented with a fresh instance of Vim. Decide if this instance is
Rainbows and Unicorns or Hideous Zombies. Once you know what you're dealing
with, tell Vim with either:
>
  :Unicorns
<
or
>
  :Zombies
<

This process will continue until the line responsible for your grief (or joy)
has been located and printed.

==============================================================================
 2. CONFIGURATION                           *zombies_vs_unicorns-configuration*

The following options are user configurable:

|'zombies_vs_unicorns_delete_backup_vimrc'|	0

See below for descriptions and default values for these options.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    *'zombies_vs_unicorns_delete_backup_vimrc'*
Values: numeric                                                              ~
Default: 0                                                                   ~

Removes the backup copy of the $MYVIMRC file after the fault localisation has
completed.

 3. OTHER                                           *zombies_vs_unicorns-other*

Fault localisation is a nontrivial procedure in complex systems such as Vim.
Zombies versus Unicorns attempts to locate faults in your $MYVIMRC only. If you
cannot locate the source of your fault with this tool, consider these other
debugging steps:

1. vim -u NONE -N

If the problem is resolved then there is a fault with your configuration --
either in your $MYVIMRC or within a plugin. To identify which, run:

2. vim -u NORC -N

If the problem is resolved then the fault is in your $MYVIMRC. This is when you
should run Zombies versus Unicorns. If you have already and it didn't help,
that sucks. :-( Perhaps you could let bairui know on freenode's #vim...

If the problem persists then the fault lies within one of your plugins. You
have several choices at this stage:

* If you are using VAM, check its documentation for its built-in plugin
  bisection tool.

* If you're using Raimondi's fork of pathogen, use the :Biscuit command.

* Otherwise, you can manually partition your plugin space by hand, moving half
  of your plugins aside and testing if the fault persists. If it still exists,
  then the fault remains in the half that you kept. If the problem disappeared,
  then the fault lies in the half you moved aside. By halving the appropriate
  set each time you will quickly (though laboriously) locate the faulty plugin.
